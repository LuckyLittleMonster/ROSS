This model is an implementation of the LA-PDES benchmark suite.

The implementation was ported from the [example code found in the Simian simulator repo](https://github.com/pujyam/simian/blob/master/Examples.Py/pdes_lanl_benchmarkV8_CTypes.py).

Details on the benchmark suite can be found in the following paper:
[E. Park et al. "Parameterized Benchmarking of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation Systems: Communication, Computation, and Memory", in Proceedings of the 2015 Winter Simulation Conference.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2888945)
